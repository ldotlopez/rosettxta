1
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,271
We are under attack. There are creatures.

2
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,690
I don't even think they're human.
We can't stop them.

3
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,860
The clock is broken. He's coming.

4
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,029
Did you hear what I said?

5
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,950
Listen to me.
There is a man coming to Versailles.

6
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:36,454
He has watched over me my whole life and he
will not desert me tonight.

7
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,664
What are you talking about? What man?

8
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:41,667
The only man, save you, I have ever loved.

9
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,379
No, don't look like that. There's no time.
You have your duties.

10
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:48,174
I am your mistress. Go to your queen.

11
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,803
Are you there? Can you hear me?

12
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:58,601
I need you now, you promised.
The clock on the mantel is broken.

13
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,269
It is time.

14
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,563
Doctor! Doctor!

15
00:01:55,324 --> 00:02:00,079
It's a spaceship. Brilliant!
I got a spaceship on my first go.

16
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,414
Looks kind of abandoned.
Anyone on board?

17
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:05,209
Nah, nothing here. Well, nothing dangerous.

18
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,461
Well, not that dangerous.

19
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,965
You know what? I'll just have a quick scan.

20
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,926
In case there's anything dangerous.

21
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,138
So, what's the date? How far have we gone?

22
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:20,015
About 3,000 years
into your future, give or take.

23
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,811
51 st century.

24
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,773
The Dagmar Cluster,
you're a long way from home, Mickey!

25
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,316
Two and a half galaxies.

26
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,027
Mickey Smith, meet the universe.

27
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,281
See anything you like?

28
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,074
It's so realistic!

29
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:42,121
Dear me, had some cowboys in here.
Been a ton of repair work going on.

30
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:49,128
Now that's odd, look at that.
All the warp engines are going.

31
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,214
Full capacity.

32
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,927
There's enough power running through this
ship to punch a hole in the universe

33
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,305
and we're not moving.

34
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,931
So where's all that power going?

35
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,892
Where'd all the crew go?

36
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,019
Good question. No life readings on board.

37
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:08,480
Well, we're in deep space.
They didn't just nip out for a quick fag.

38
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:10,816
No, I've checked all the smoking pods.

39
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,987
- You smell that?
- Yeah. Someone's cooking.

40
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,530
Sunday roast, definitely.

41
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,790
Now, there's something you don't
see in your average spaceship.

42
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,544
18th century. French.

43
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,421
Nice mantel.

44
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,507
Not a hologram.

45
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:41,388
Not even a reproduction. This
actually is an 18th-century French fireplace.

46
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,557
Double-sided.
There's another room through there.

47
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:45,893
It can't be.
That's the outer hull of the ship. Look.

48
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,103
- Hello.
- Hello?

49
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,648
- What's your name?
- Reinette.

50
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,025
Reinette. That's a lovely name.

51
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,778
Can you tell me where you are
at the moment, Reinette?

52
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,446
In my bedroom.

53
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,282
And where's your bedroom?
Where do you live, Reinette?

54
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:02,868
- Paris of course.
- Paris. Right.

55
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,580
Monsieur, what are you doing in my fireplace?

56
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:10,542
Oh, it's just a routine...fire check.

57
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,127
Can you tell me what year it is?

58
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:15,506
Of course I can. 1727.

59
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,259
Right, lovely, one of my favorites.

60
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,303
August is rubbish, though. Stay indoors.

61
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:24,265
Okay, that's all for now. Thanks for your help.

62
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,642
Hope you enjoy the rest of the fire.
Night-night.

63
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,519
<i>Good night, monsieur.</i>

64
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,271
You said this was the 51st century.

65
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:33,565
I also said this ship was generating enough
power to punch a hole in the universe.

66
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,693
I think we just found the hole.

67
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,570
- Must be a spatio-temporal hyperlink.
- What's that?

68
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:42,491
No idea, just made it up.
Didn't want to say "magic door".

69
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:47,371
And on the other
side of the "magic door" it's France in 1727?

70
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,874
Well, she was speaking French.
Right period French, too.

71
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,584
She was speaking English, I heard her.

72
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,420
That's the Tardis, translates for you.

73
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,338
- Even French?
- Yep.

74
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,133
- Got you.
- Doctor!

75
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:29,788
It's okay. Don't scream. It's me.
It's the fireplace man, look.

76
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,170
We were talking. Just a moment ago.
I was in your fireplace.

77
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,840
Monsieur, that was weeks ago.
That was months.

78
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,343
Really? Hmm.

79
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:49,641
Must be a loose connection.
Need to get a man in.

80
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,478
Who are you and what are you doing here?

81
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:59,109
- Okay. That's scary.
- You're scared of a broken clock?

82
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,487
Just a bit scared, yeah. Just a little tiny bit.

83
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,656
'Cause, you see, if this clock's broken,

84
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,326
and it's the only clock in the room,

85
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,705
then what's that?

86
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,586
'Cause, you see, that's not a clock.

87
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,589
You can tell by the resonance. Too big.

88
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,304
Six feet, I'd say. Size of a man.

89
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,973
What is it?

90
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,725
Now let's think.

91
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,436
If you were a thing that ticked and you were
hiding in someone's bedroom,

92
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,105
first thing you do, break the clock.

93
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,400
No one notices the sound
of one clock ticking, but two?

94
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,738
You might start to wonder
if you're really alone.

95
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,077
Stay on the bed. Right in the middle.

96
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,247
Don't put your hands or feet over the edge.

97
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,316
Reinette, don't look round.

98
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,446
You stay exactly where you are.

99
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,954
Hold still, let me look.

100
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,459
You've been scanning her brain!

101
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,462
You've crossed two galaxies
and thousands of years

102
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:42,921
just to scan a child's brain?

103
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,673
What could there be in a little girl's mind...

104
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:48,343
worth blowing a hole in the universe?
I don't understand.

105
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,387
It wants me?

106
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,806
You want me?

107
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,851
<i>Not yet. You are incomplete.</i>

108
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,937
Incomplete?
What does that mean, incomplete?

109
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:02,733
You can answer her, you can answer me.
What do you mean, incomplete?

110
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,406
Monsieur, be careful!

111
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,533
It's just a nightmare, Reinette.
Don't worry about it.

112
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,702
Everyone has nightmares.

113
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:17,247
Even monsters from under the
bed have nightmares. Don't you, Monster?

114
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,666
What do monsters have nightmares about?

115
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,043
Me. Ha!

116
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,130
Doctor!

117
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,311
Excellent. Ice gun.

118
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,771
Fire extinguisher.

119
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,856
- Where did that thing come from?
- Here.

120
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,316
So why is it dressed like that?

121
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,277
Field trip to France.
Some kind of basic camouflage protocol.

122
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,197
Nice needlework. Shame about the face.

123
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,910
Oh, you are beautiful!

124
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,831
No, really, you are. You're gorgeous.
Look at that!

125
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,709
Space age clockwork. I love it. I've got chills!

126
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,253
Listen, seriously,

127
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,713
I mean this from the heart,
and by the way, count those,

128
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:10,884
it would be a crime,
it would be an act of vandalism,

129
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,844
to disassemble you.

130
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,138
But that won't stop me.

131
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,355
Short-range teleport. Can't have got far.
Could still be on board.

132
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,899
- What is it?
- Don't go looking for it.

133
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,402
- Where are you going?
- Back in a sec.

134
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,828
- He said not to look for it.
- Yeah, he did.

135
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,627
Now you're getting it.

136
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,550
Reinette?

137
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,595
Just checking you're okay.

138
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,275
Oh. Hello!

139
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:14,948
I was just looking for Reinette.
This is still her room, isn't it?

140
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,243
I've been away, not sure how long.

141
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:20,662
Reinette? We're ready to go!

142
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,124
Go to the carriage, Mother,
I will join you there.

143
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,963
It is customary, I think,
to have an imaginary friend

144
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,382
only during one's childhood.

145
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,218
You are to be congratulated
on your persistence.

146
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,678
Reinette.

147
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,474
Well...

148
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,142
Goodness, how you've grown.

149
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,520
And you do not appear
to have aged a single day.

150
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,315
That is tremendously impolite of you.

151
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,734
Right, yes, sorry. Um...

152
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:56,823
Listen, lovely to catch up
but better be off, eh?

153
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:00,035
Don't want your mother finding
you up here with a strange man, do we?

154
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,704
Strange? How could you be a stranger to me?

155
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,082
I have known you since I was seven years old.

156
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,211
Yeah, I suppose you have.
I came the quick route.

157
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:17,177
You seem to be flesh
and blood at any rate, but this is absurd.

158
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,805
Reason tells me you cannot be real.

159
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,933
Oh, you never want to listen to reason.

160
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,062
<i>Mademoiselle?
Your mother</i> grows <i>impatient.</i>

161
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,605
A moment!

162
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,943
So many questions. So little time.

163
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,248
<i>Mademoiselle Poisson!</i>

164
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,052
Poisson?

165
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,390
Reinette Poisson. No!

166
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,893
No, no, no, no! No way! Reinette Poisson.

167
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,229
Later Madame d'Etioles.
Later still, mistress of Louis XV,

168
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,064
uncrowned Queen of France!

169
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,818
Actress, artist, musician, dancer, courtesan.

170
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,653
Fantastic gardener.

171
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,907
Who the hell are you?

172
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:25,162
I'm the Doctor.
And I just snogged Madame de Pompadour.

173
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,959
Rose!

174
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,673
Mickey! Every time. Every time! It's rule one.
Don't wander off.

175
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,009
I tell them, I do. Rule one.

176
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,803
There could be anything on this ship!

177
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,200
Are you looking at me?

178
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,038
Look! Look at this!

179
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,211
That's an eye in there. That's a real eye.

180
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,688
What is that?

181
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:37,484
What's that in the middle there?
Looks like it's wired in.

182
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,528
It's a heart, Mickey.

183
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,031
It's a human heart.

184
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,077
Rose?

185
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,087
Will you stop following me?
I'm not your mother.

186
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,427
So this is where you came from, eh, horsey?

187
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,520
Oh, Katherine, you are too wicked.

188
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,606
Oh, speaking of wicked,

189
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,235
I hear Madame de
Chateauroux is ill and close to death.

190
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,947
- Yes, I am devastated.
- Oh, indeed.

191
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,950
I, myself, am frequently inconsolable.

192
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:31,413
The King will
therefore be requiring a new mistress.

193
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,956
You love the King, of course.

194
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:36,376
He is the King and I love him with all my heart.

195
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,379
And I look forward to meeting him.

196
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,385
Is something wrong, my dear?

197
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,470
Not wrong, no.

198
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,892
Every woman in Paris knows your ambitions.

199
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,977
Every woman in Paris
shares them.

200
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,605
You know, of course, that the
King is to attend the Yew Tree Ball...

201
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,823
<i>- Maybe it wasn't a real heart.
- Of course it was a real heart.</i>

202
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,828
<i>Is this, like, normal for you?
Is this an average day?</i>

203
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:15,248
Life with the Doctor, Mickey,
no more average days.

204
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,126
It's France again. We can see France.

205
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,172
I think we're looking through a mirror.

206
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,342
Blimey, look at this guy!

207
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,677
- Who does he think he is?
- King of France.

208
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,097
- Oh, here's trouble. What you been up to?
- Oh, this and that.

209
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,433
Became the imaginary friend
of a future French aristocrat,

210
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,101
picked a fight with a clockwork man.

211
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,271
Oh, and I met a horse.

212
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,690
What's a horse doing on a spaceship?

213
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,943
Mickey, what's pre-revolutionary
France doing on a spaceship?

214
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,527
Get a little perspective.

215
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:48,156
See these?
They're all over the place, on every deck.

216
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,200
Gateways to history.

217
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:54,204
But not just any old history. Hers.

218
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,790
Time window.

219
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,960
Deliberately arranged
along the life of one particular woman.

220
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:04,881
A spaceship from the 51st
century stalking a woman from the 18th.

221
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,300
- Why?
- Who is she?

222
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,053
Jean-Antoinette Poisson.
Known to her friends as Reinette.

223
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,055
One of the most
accomplished women who ever lived.

224
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,140
So has she got plans
for being the queen, then?

225
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:18,061
No, he's already got a queen.
She's got plans on being his mistress.

226
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,481
Oh, I get it. Camilla!

227
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,986
I think this is the night they met.

228
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,904
The night of the Yew Tree Ball.

229
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,740
In no time flat, she'll get
herself established as his official mistress

230
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,243
with her own
rooms at the palace, even her own title.

231
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,161
Madame de Pompadour.

232
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,335
The Queen must have loved her.

233
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,921
No, she did. They got on very well.

234
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,923
The King's wife and the King's girlfriend?

235
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,175
France. It's a different planet.

236
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:58,685
How long have you been standing there?
Show yourself!

237
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,025
Hello, Reinette, hasn't time flown!

238
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,068
Fireplace man!

239
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,871
- What's it doing?
- Switching back on. Melting the ice.

240
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,041
- And then what?
- Then it kills everyone in the room.

241
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:25,086
Focuses the mind, doesn't it? Who are you?
Identify yourself.

242
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,839
Order it to answer me.

243
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,382
Why should it listen to me?

244
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,260
I don't know, but it did when you were a child.

245
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,888
Let's see if you've still got it.

246
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,057
Answer his question.

247
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,102
Answer any and all questions put to you.

248
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,566
<i>I am Repair Droid 7.</i>

249
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,735
And what happened to the ship, then?

250
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,112
There was a lot of damage.

251
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,782
<i>Ion storm. 82% systems failure.</i>

252
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:57,118
That ship hasn't moved in over a year.
What's taken you so long?

253
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,454
<i>We did not have the parts.</i>

254
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,458
Always comes down to that, doesn't it?
The parts.

255
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,376
What's happened to the crew?
Where are they?

256
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,212
<i>We did not have the parts.</i>

257
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,298
There should've been over 50
people on your ship. Where did they go?

258
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,925
<i>We did not have the parts.</i>

259
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,053
Fifty people don't just disappear, where...

260
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,430
Oh.

261
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:22,560
You didn't have the parts
so you used the crew.

262
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,687
The crew?

263
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,275
We found a camera with an eye in it.

264
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,655
And there was a heart wired into machinery.

265
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,700
It's just doing what it was programmed to.

266
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,704
Repairing the ship any way it
can with whatever it can find.

267
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,582
No one told it the crew weren't on the menu.

268
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,710
What did you say the flight deck smelled of?

269
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,588
Someone cooking.

270
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,382
Flesh plus heat.

271
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,843
Barbecue.

272
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,138
But what are you doing here?

273
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,974
You've opened up time windows,
that takes colossal energy.

274
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,893
Why come here?
You could've gone to your repair yard.

275
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:07,021
Instead you come to 18th-century France?
Why?

276
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,940
<i>One more part is required.</i>

277
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,197
Then why haven't you taken it?

278
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,116
<i>She is incomplete.</i>

279
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,411
What? So that's the plan, then?

280
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,038
Just keep opening up
more and more time windows,

281
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,958
scanning her brain,
checking to see if she's done yet?

282
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,543
Why her?

283
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:35,133
You've got all of
history to choose from, why specifically her?

284
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,844
<i>We are the same.</i>

285
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,471
We're not the same.
We are in no sense the same!

286
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,765
- We are the same.
- Get out of here.

287
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,310
- Get out of here this instant.
- Reinette, no.

288
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,855
It's back on the ship! Rose,
take Mickey and Arthur, get after it, follow it.

289
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,523
Don't approach it, just watch what it does.

290
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,192
- Arthur?
- Good name for a horse.

291
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,902
No, you're not keeping the horse.

292
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,321
I let you keep Mickey. Now go, go, go!

293
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,827
You're going to have to trust me.
I need to find out what they're looking for.

294
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:06,331
There's only one way I can do that.
Won't hurt a bit.

295
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,919
Fireplace man.

296
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,588
You are inside my mind.

297
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,423
Oh, dear, Reinette.

298
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,800
You've had some cowboys in here.

299
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,846
- So, that Doctor, eh?
- What are you talking about?

300
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,600
Well! Madame de Pompadour,
Sarah Jane Smith.

301
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,269
- Cleopatra...
- Cleopatra! He mentioned her once!

302
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,147
- Yeah, but he called her Cleo.
- Mickey!

303
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,660
You are in my memories.
You walk among them.

304
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,495
If there's anything you don't want me to see,

305
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,790
just imagine a door and close it. I won't look.

306
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,503
Oh, actually, there's a door just
there, you might want to close...

307
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,588
Oh. Actually, several.

308
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,635
To walk among the memories
of another living soul.

309
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,930
- Do you ever get used to this?
- I don't make a habit of it.

310
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:07,141
- How can you resist?
- What age are you?

311
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:10,895
So impertinent a question
so early in the conversation.

312
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,440
- How promising.
- Not my question. Theirs.

313
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:18,695
You're 23. And for some reason
that means you're not old enough.

314
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,782
Sorry. You might find old
memories reawakening. Side effect.

315
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,909
Oh, such a lonely childhood.

316
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,078
It'll pass. Stay with me.

317
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:32,792
Oh, Doctor. So lonely. So very, very alone.

318
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,629
What do you mean, alone?
You've never been alone in your life.

319
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,965
When did you start calling me Doctor?

320
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,217
Such a lonely little boy.

321
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,636
Lonely then and lonelier now.

322
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,391
- How can you bear it?
- How did you do that?

323
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:53,604
A door once opened
may be stepped through in either direction.

324
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,274
Oh, Doctor.

325
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,860
My lonely Doctor.

326
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,281
Dance with me.

327
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:04,866
I can't.

328
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,826
Dance with me.

329
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,953
This is the night you dance with the King.

330
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,205
Then first I shall make him jealous.

331
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,541
- I can't.
- Doctor.

332
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,919
Doctor who?

333
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,842
It's more than just a secret, isn't it?

334
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,511
What did you see?

335
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,891
That there comes a time, Time Lord,

336
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:33,144
when every lonely little boy
must learn how to dance.

337
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:49,202
What is this? What's going on? Doctor?

338
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,787
Rose?

339
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,415
They're going to chop us up.
Just like the crew!

340
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,460
They're going to chop us up
and stick us all over their stupid spaceship.

341
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,962
And where's the Doctor?
Where's your precious Doctor now?

342
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:03,883
He's been gone
for flipping hours, that's where he is!

343
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,802
<i>You are compatible.</i>

344
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,765
Well, you might want to think about that.

345
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:14,727
You really, really might
because me and Mickey,

346
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,897
we didn't come here alone, no, no.

347
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,110
And trust me, you wouldn't want to
mess with our designated driver.

348
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,368
Ever heard of the Daleks? Remember them?

349
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,745
They had a name for our friend.

350
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,374
They had myths about him and a name.
They called him the...

351
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:40,336
<i>a' I could have danced all night</i>

352
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,880
They called him...

353
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:46,843
<i>♪ And still have begged for more</i>

354
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:50,388
<i>♪ I could have spread my wings
And done a... a'</i>

355
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,598
Have you met the French?

356
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:56,144
My God, they know how to party!

357
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:59,647
Oh, look at what the cat dragged in.
The Oncoming Storm.

358
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,482
You sound just like your mother.

359
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,568
What have you been doing?
Where have you been?

360
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,695
Well, among other things,

361
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,740
I think I just invented the banana
daiquiri a couple of centuries early.

362
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:12,702
Do you know,
they'd never even seen a banana before?

363
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,705
Always take a banana to a party, Rose.

364
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,876
Bananas are good. Oh, brilliant.

365
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,170
It's you!

366
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,547
You're my favorite, you are.

367
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,591
You are the best. Do you know why?

368
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,343
'Cause you're so thick.

369
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,638
You're Mr. Thick Thick Thicketty Thick-face

370
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:35,099
from Thick-town, Thickania.

371
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,269
And so is your dad.

372
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,772
Do you know what
they were scanning Reinette's brain for?

373
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:45,943
Her milometer.
They want to know how old she is.

374
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:50,448
Know why? 'Cause this ship is 37 years old.

375
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:54,494
And they think
when Reinette is 37, when she's complete,

376
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:57,163
then her brain will be compatible.

377
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,458
'Cause that's
what you're missing, isn't it, hmm?

378
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,960
Command circuit, your computer.

379
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:07,340
Your ship needs a brain.
And for some reason, God knows what,

380
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:10,885
only the brain
of Madame de Pompadour will do.

381
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,430
<i>The brain is compatible.</i>

382
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,015
Compatible?

383
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:21,270
If you believe that,
you probably believe this is a glass of wine.

384
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:32,615
Multi-grade anti-oil. If it moves, it doesn't.

385
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:43,000
Right, you two, that's enough lying about.
Time we got the rest of the ship turned off.

386
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:45,169
- Those things safe?
- Yep, safe.

387
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:46,879
Safe and thick. The way I like them.

388
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,798
Okay, all the time windows
are controlled from here.

389
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,843
Need to close them all down. Zeus plugs.
Where are my Zeus plugs?

390
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,679
Had them a minute ago.
I was using them as castanets.

391
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:57,306
Why didn't they
just open a time window to when she was 37?

392
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:00,101
Amount of damage to these
circuits, they did well to hit the right century.

393
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,228
Trial and error after that.

394
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,939
The windows aren't closing.
Why won't they close?

395
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,818
- What's that?
- I don't know.

396
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,903
- Incoming message?
- From who?

397
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,613
Report from the field.

398
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,615
One of them must
still be out there with Reinette.

399
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:17,994
That's why I can't close the windows.
There's an override.

400
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,626
That was a bit clever.

401
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,883
Right.
Many things about this are not good.

402
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,722
Message from one of your little friends?
Anything interesting?

403
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,016
<i>She is complete. It begins.</i>

404
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,063
What's happening?

405
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,024
One of them must have found
the right time window.

406
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,567
It's time to send in the troops.

407
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,736
And this time they're bringing back her head.

408
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,417
Madame de Pompadour.

409
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,253
Please don't scream or
anything, we haven't got a lot of time.

410
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,173
We've come to warn you
that they'll be here in five years.

411
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,633
Five years?

412
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:16,302
Sometime after your 37th birthday.

413
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:21,474
I, um, I can't give
you an exact date, it's a bit random.

414
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:24,352
But they're coming. It's gonna happen.

415
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,481
In a way, for us, it's already happening.

416
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,736
I'm sorry, it's hard to explain.
The Doctor does this better.

417
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,905
Then be exact and I will be attentive.

418
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,908
- There isn't time.
- There are five years.

419
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,243
For you. I haven't got five minutes.

420
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,245
Then also be concise.

421
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,583
Um...

422
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,754
There's a vessel.

423
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:56,425
A ship. A sort of sky ship. And it's full of...

424
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,720
Well, you.

425
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:03,182
Different bits of your life in different rooms.
All jumbled up.

426
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,060
I told you it was complicated, sorry.

427
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,772
There is a vessel in your world

428
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,024
where the days of my life are pressed together

429
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:13,984
like the chapters of a book

430
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:17,655
so that he may step
from one to the other without increase of age

431
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,533
while I, weary traveler,

432
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,993
must always take the slower path.

433
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,121
He was right about you.

434
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:29,583
So in five years these creatures will return.
What can be done?

435
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,293
The Doctor says keep them talking.

436
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,714
They're kind of programmed
to respond to you now.

437
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:38,426
You won't be able to stop them, but you might
be able to delay them a bit.

438
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:41,429
- Until?
- Until the Doctor can get there.

439
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,931
- He's coming, then?
- He promises.

440
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,393
But he cannot make his promises in person?

441
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:52,148
He'll be there when you need him.
That's the way it's got to be.

442
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,692
It's the way it's always been.

443
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,361
The monsters and the Doctor.

444
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:00,531
It seems you cannot have one
without the other.

445
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,700
Tell me about it.

446
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:08,122
The thing is,
you weren't supposed to have either.

447
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:11,208
Those creatures are messing with history.

448
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:13,335
None of this was ever
supposed to happen to you.

449
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,338
Supposed to happen? What does that mean?

450
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:21,218
It happened, child.
And I would not have it any other way.

451
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:25,598
One may tolerate
a world of demons for the sake of an angel.

452
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,187
Rose? Rose!

453
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:34,440
Rose!

454
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:39,028
The time window where she's 37.
We've found it, right under our noses.

455
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,868
No, you can't go in there.
The Doctor will go mad.

456
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:54,919
So this is his world.

457
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,173
What was that?

458
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,675
The time window.
The Doctor fixed an audio link.

459
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:05,012
Those screams. Is that my future?

460
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,515
Yeah, I'm sorry.

461
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:10,017
Then I must take the slower path.

462
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,937
<i>Are you there? Can you hear me?</i>

463
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,066
<i>I need you now. You promised.
The clock on the mantel is broken. It is time!</i>

464
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,442
That's my voice.

465
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:20,903
Rose, come on, we've got to go.
There's a problem.

466
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,696
Give me a moment.

467
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,705
- You okay?
- No.

468
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,208
I'm very afraid.

469
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,336
But you and I both know, don't we, Rose?

470
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,922
The Doctor is worth the monsters.

471
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,431
<i>Doctor! Doctor!</i>

472
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,242
Doctor!

473
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:11,495
We must go! No one is coming to help us.

474
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:23,007
<i>You are complete. You will come.</i>

475
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,893
You found it, then?

476
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,478
They knew I was coming,
they've blocked it off.

477
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,481
<i>- Where are we going?
- The teleport has limited range.</i>

478
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:42,234
<i>We must have proximity to the time portal.</i>

479
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,279
Your words mean nothing. You are nothing.

480
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:50,451
- How come they got in there?
- They teleported.

481
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,453
As long as the ship
and the ballroom are linked,

482
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,038
their short-range teleports will do the trick.

483
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:57,166
- We'll go in the Tardis.
- We can't. We're part of events now.

484
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,667
Can't we just smash through?

485
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,836
Hyperplex this side, plate glass the other.
We'd need a truck.

486
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,796
- We don't have a truck.
- I know!

487
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,298
We've got to try something!

488
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,008
No. Smash the glass,
smash the time windows.

489
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,801
There'd be no way back.

490
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:11,680
<i>Could everyone just calm down!</i>

491
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,141
<i>Please!</i>

492
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:17,394
Such a commotion. Such distressing noise.

493
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:21,231
Kindly remember that this is Versailles.

494
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,818
This is the Royal Court and we are French.

495
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,201
I have made a decision.

496
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,162
And my decision is no.

497
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,040
I shall not be going with you today.

498
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:42,127
I have seen your world and
I have no desire to set foot there again.

499
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,547
<i>We do not require your feet.</i>

500
00:32:56,308 --> 00:33:00,437
You think I fear you,
but I do not fear you even now.

501
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:05,901
You are merely
the nightmare of my childhood,

502
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,153
the monster from under my bed.

503
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:10,614
And if my nightmare can return to plague me,

504
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:13,450
then rest assured, so will yours.

505
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:50,904
Madame de Pompadour.
You look younger every day.

506
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,949
What the hell is going on?

507
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,745
Oh. This is my lover, the King of France.

508
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:01,081
Yeah? Well, I'm the Lord of Time.

509
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:06,086
And I'm here to fix the clock.

510
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,424
Forget it. It's over.

511
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,594
For you and for me.

512
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,723
Talk about seven years' bad luck.

513
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,642
Try 3,000.

514
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:29,193
What happened?

515
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:33,072
Where did the time window go?
How's he gonna get back?

516
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,383
The link with the ship is broken. No way back.

517
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,304
You don't have the parts.

518
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:02,559
How many ticks left
in that clockwork heart, huh?

519
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,686
A day? An hour?

520
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,191
It's over. Accept that.

521
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:12,820
I'm not winding you up.

522
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,837
Are you all right?

523
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,049
What's happened to them?

524
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,885
They've stopped.

525
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,430
They have no purpose now.

526
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:54,236
We can't fly the Tardis without him.

527
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,113
How's he gonna get back?

528
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,966
You know all their names, don't you?

529
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:18,719
I saw that in your mind.

530
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,762
The name of every star.

531
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,472
What's in a name?

532
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:25,434
Names are just titles.
Titles don't tell you anything.

533
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,477
Like "the Doctor"?

534
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:29,771
Like "Madame de Pompadour".

535
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:35,903
I have often wished
to see those stars a little closer.

536
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:38,030
Just as you have, I think.

537
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,948
From time to time.

538
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,285
In saving me, you trapped yourself.

539
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,621
Did you know that would happen?

540
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,831
Hmm, pretty much.

541
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,958
Yet still you came.

542
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:53,712
Yeah, I did, didn't I?
Catch me doing that again.

543
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:58,967
There were many doors
between my world and yours.

544
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,261
Can you not use one of the others?

545
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,721
When the mirror broke,

546
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,932
the shock would've severed
all the links with the ship.

547
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:09,603
There'll be a few more broken mirrors and
torn tapestries around here I'm afraid,

548
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,813
wherever there was a time window.

549
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:14,816
I'll pay for any damage.

550
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,987
That's a thought, I'm gonna need money.

551
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,198
I've always been a bit vague about money.

552
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,534
Where do you get money?

553
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,328
So here you are.

554
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,331
My lonely angel.

555
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,376
Stuck on the slow path with me.

556
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,336
Yep. The slow path.

557
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,464
Here's to the slow path.

558
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:47,349
It's a pity.
I think I would have enjoyed the slow path.

559
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,435
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

560
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:53,021
Oh, aren't you?

561
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,441
Take my hand.

562
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,966
It's not a copy. It's the original.

563
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:25,304
I had it moved here
and was exact in every detail.

564
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,473
The fireplace.

565
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,937
The fireplace from your bedroom.

566
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,443
- When did you do this?
- Many years ago.

567
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,906
In the hope that a door once
opened may someday open again.

568
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:50,162
One never quite knows
when one needs one's doctor.

569
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:55,667
It appears undamaged.
Do you think it will still work?

570
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,836
You broke
the bond with the ship when you moved it.

571
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,088
Which means it was off-line
when the mirror broke.

572
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,090
That's what saved it.

573
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:04,634
But...

574
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:10,182
the link is basically physical
and it's still physically here,

575
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:15,270
which might just mean, if I'm lucky,

576
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:18,148
if I'm very, very, very, very, very lucky...

577
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:21,818
- Aha!
- What?

578
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,862
Loose connection!

579
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,864
Need to get a man in!

580
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,702
- Wish me luck.
- No.

581
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,001
Madame de Pompadour!

582
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,380
Still wanna see those stars?

583
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:44,299
- More than anything.
- Give me two minutes. Pack a bag.

584
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:45,717
Am I going somewhere?

585
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:48,678
Go to the window. Pick a star. Any star.

586
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,069
- How long did you wait?
- Five and half hours.

587
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,279
Great! Always wait five and half hours.

588
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:07,489
Where've you been?

589
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,617
Explain later. Into the Tardis.
With you in a sec!

590
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,077
Reinette.

591
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:15,705
Are you there, Reinette?

592
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,010
Reinette?

593
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:32,514
Oh, hello.

594
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,684
You just missed her.

595
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,563
- She'll be in Paris by 6:00.
- Oh.

596
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,234
Good Lord!

597
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,028
She was right.

598
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,866
She said you never looked a day older.

599
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,912
So many years since I saw you
last, but not a day of it on your face.

600
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,301
She spoke of you many times.

601
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,555
Often wished you'd visit again.

602
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,266
You know how women are.

603
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,114
And there she goes.

604
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,576
Leaving Versailles for the last time.

605
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,330
Only 43 when she died.

606
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,500
Too young.

607
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,252
Too young.

608
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,423
Illness took her in the end.

609
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,927
She always did work too hard.

610
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:00,268
What does she say?

611
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,280
Of course.

612
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,158
Quite right.

613
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,304
Why her?

614
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,516
Why did they think they could repair the ship

615
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:41,935
with the head of Madame de Pompadour?

616
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,104
We'll probably never know.

617
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,523
There's massive damage
in the computer memory decks.

618
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,858
Probably got confused.

619
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:51,194
The Tardis can close down the time windows

620
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,572
now the droids have gone.

621
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,658
Should stop it causing any more trouble.

622
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,705
You all right?

623
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,833
I'm always all right.

624
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,176
Come on, Rose, it's time you showed
me round the rest of this place.

625
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:37,991
<i>"My dear Doctor,</i>

626
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:42,787
<i>"the path has never seemed
more slow and yet I fear I am nearing its end.</i>

627
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:47,417
<i>"Reason tells
me that you and I are unlikely to meet again,</i>

628
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:50,545
<i>"but I think I shall not listen to reason.</i>

629
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:55,592
<i>"I have seen the world inside your head and
know that all things are possible.</i>

630
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,470
<i>"Hurry, though, my love.</i>

631
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,723
<i>"My days grow shorter now
and I am so very weak.</i>

632
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:04,934
<i>"Godspeed, my lonely angel."</i>

633
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:14,963
So this is London.

634
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,881
An alternative to our world
where everything's the same

635
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,466
but a little bit different.

636
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,927
We're in some sort of no place.

637
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,763
All those people disappearing off the streets,

638
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:25,640
it's been going on for months.

639
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,769
- What are they all doing?
- It's the earpieces.

640
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:33,606
The prototype
has passed every test, sir.

641
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,483
It's working.

642
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,485
I've seen them before.

643
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,279
What are they?

644
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:43,783
Skin of metal and a body that will never age.

645
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:44,868
Cybers.
